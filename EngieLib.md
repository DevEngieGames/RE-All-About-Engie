- **This mod is a library mod made for my other mods.**
- **This mod does add some new things, however it's not enough to fully impact vanilla minecraft or modded minecraft to a point where it's a complete extention.**
  - Currently it's just commands.
  - The one command that most of my mods will rely off is "/EngieLib" as that will have most of the stuff needed for everything.
- **This mod does modify the textures of Minecraft itself however, some are for compatibility reasons. The others are because I felt like modifying it anyway.**
  - It's mostly GUI anyway.
