I have been given permission by the original owner (AKA [DevEngie](https://modrinth.com/user/DevEngie)) due to the guy having technical issues and due to this he can no longer update [All About Engie](https://modrinth.com/mod/all-about-engie) so hence the permission for reuploading the mod being given to me([EngieGames](https://modrinth.com/user/EngieGames)). Here is a screenshot of me quote posting [DevEngie](https://modrinth.com/user/DevEngie) on X for proof of the permission being granted.

You could also call this a Fork of [All About Engie](https://modrinth.com/mod/all-about-engie), whatever floats your boat though. :)
